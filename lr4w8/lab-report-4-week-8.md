# Lab Report 4 Week 8

[My implementation](https://github.com/PierreBeur/markdown-parse)

[The implementation I reviewed](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse)

## Snippet 1

What should it produce?

```
@Test
public void testSnippet1() {
    MarkdownParse.getLinks();
}
```

For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

For the implementation you reviewed, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

## Snippet 2

What should it produce?

```
@Test
public void testSnippet2() {
    
}
```

For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

For the implementation you reviewed, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

## Snippet 3

What should it produce?

```
@Test
public void testSnippet3() {
    
}
```

For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
